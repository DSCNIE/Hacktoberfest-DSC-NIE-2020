and help in constantly improving that piece of code.
Open source technology and open source thinking both benefit programmers and non-programmers.
Open Source philosophy encourages collaboration on a global level. Some of the greatest software of all time is a result of
constant collaboration with some of the most awesome people in the world.

of Open Source and giving back to the community. 

No matter what your skill level, Hacktoberfest is an awesome way to get into using the workflow of git and github and undestand how Open Source development works.
